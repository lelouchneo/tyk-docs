## What is a Tyk Long Term Support (LTS) release

A Tyk LTS release is usually aimed at customers who want predictability and stability. It means that throughout the lifetime of the release, there will be a commitment to update, fix and maintain the elements that are part of the release. Tyk's LTS releases are scheduled for Q1 release annually.

## How do we support LTS releases?

Hereâ€™s what you need to know about how we support an LTS release at Tyk:

An LTS release at Tyk is left on production for 3 months in [Hypercare](#what-is-hypercare) - a period immediately after a release where an elevated period of support is available, patches are run based on need and criticality, and single fix patching is done whenever needed. During this period, the release is carefully monitored and anything that needs fixing is fixed then and there to ensure stability.

During the Hypercare period, measures are taken to stabilise the release, and breaking changes are released. All this is done while also aiming for backward compatibility.

After the Hypercare 3 month period, this release is labelled as a recommended release to customers. This is followed by full support for 12 months. This means that the release will be on full support for 15 months.

**Note**

Minor releases are not a part of the LTS but are fully supported until the next minor release is live. See [How do we support minor releases?](#how-do-we-support-minor-releases)
{{< /note >}}

After 12 months, there is a new LTS release, and the previous version remains in full support for a further 3 months before it moves into [extended support](#what-is-extended-support).

If you are on an LTS release (RX.0), you can directly put any minor release on top of that( RX.1, RX.2, etc) instead of installing the previous version of the minor release.

## What Happens To Our Patches When We Release A LTS Release?

Our procedure for handling patches during LTS release is straightforward. Upon release of a new long-term support version (usually in March), we allow it some time to settle (until the end of May), and then make it our recommended release.

Therefore, from March to May, we continue to issue patches for both the previous LTS branch and the new one. In June, we only provide patches for the new LTS, while the previous one enters extended support which only covers critical fixes.

### Here's an illustration:

Our current LTS release is version 4, and our new LTS release 5 is expected in March.

During April and May, we will release these patches:
- For version 4 LTS - versions 4.0.13 and 4.0.14
- For the new version 5 - versions 5.0.1 and 5.0.2

In June, version 5 becomes the recommended version; we will release the next major version of release 5 (5.1) and a patch for the new LTS (5.0.3).

At this point, release 4 LTS will enter into *extended support* which only covers critical fixes.


## Pump

As updates to Tyk Pump are deployable quickly with low risk and no breaking changes, Tyk will support the latest major version (I.e Pump 1.7) until the next major version (1.8) is released. Then we'd support that version.

To help assure backward compatibility we ensure that the each version of Pump we release works with the gateway and dashboard versions which is under long term support at that time. For example, we'd ensure Pump 1.7 is compatible with release 4 of Tyk gateway and Tyk Manager (dashboard), and this increments with the long term support model.

If we need to patch a major Pump version , we would number that as a minor version (1.7.1).

## Other Components

Tyk Identity Broker (TIB),  MDCB, and Operator components are not part of the Long-Term Support (LTS) policy yet. We will continue to support all versions of these components and will offer advice to clients on when to upgrade if necessary.

## What is Hypercare?

Hypercare is a period immediately after a release where an elevated period of support is available. We run patches based on need and criticality, and single fix patching can be done if the severity and impact of a bug denotes that a fix is critical.

## What Is Extended Support?
In the extended support period Tyk will continue to patch any production critical patches and security issues, we will not add new features to the platform during this period.

**Note**

From R4 onwards, extended support will be for 12 months after the full support end date.

## How do we support minor releases?

We only patch minor releases (4.1. 4.2, 4.3, etc) until the next minor is out.

### Example for release 4
 - Tyk's next LTS patch release will be 4.0.3, and a minor release (4.1) will have all of the 4.0.3 patches
 - The following LTS patch release will be 4.0.4 and the minor release 4.1 will be patched, becoming 4.1.1
 - The following LTS patch will be 4.0.5 and the minor release 4.1.1 will be patched, becoming 4.1.2
 - The following LTS patch will be 4.0.6 and a new minor release (4.2) will have all of the 4.0.6 patches
 - At this point we stop supporting minor release 4.1 and only patch 4.2
 - This schedule is repeated until the next LTS release
