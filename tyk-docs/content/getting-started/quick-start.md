At Tyk we understand that getting started with any tool can be overwhelming and time-consuming. This is the reason we created two projects to give you a quick start in minutes - 
[tyk-demo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-demo) and [tyk-k8s-demo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo) 
projects. The idea is to provide an enriched environment with many integrations that can act as integration examples 
as well as demonstrate Tyk's capabilities.

These open-source projects are actively being updated and improved. They are also being used daily by Tyk engineers. If you have questions or would like to 
request us to build a certain integration or to add a new example, please submit a request to each of the repos respectively. 

Docker compose environment - [tyk-demo]({{< ref "/getting-started/quick-start/tyk-demo.md" >}})

Kubernetes environment - [tyk-k8s-demo]({{< ref "/getting-started/quick-start/tyk-k8s-demo.md" >}})
