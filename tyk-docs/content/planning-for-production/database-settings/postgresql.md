## Introduction

How you configure your PostgreSQL installation depends on whether you are installing Tyk from fresh using PostgreSQL, or are migrating from an existing MongoDB instance.

## Prerequisites

In a production environment, Tyk only supports the following PostgreSQL versions in v4.0.0:

* PostgreSQL - versions 13.3, 12.7, 11.12, 10.17, 9.6.22


## Migrating from an existing MongoDB instance

For v4.0 we have provided a migration command that will help you migrate all data from the main storage layer (APIs, Policies, Users, UserGroups, Webhooks, Certificates, Portal Settings, Portal Catalogues, Portal Pages, Portal CSS etc.).

**Note**  

The migration tool will not migrate any Logs, Analytics or Uptime analytics data.

1. Make sure your new SQL platform and the existing MongoDB instance are both running
2. Configure the `main` part of  `storage` section of your `tyk-analytics.conf`:

```
{
...
  "storage": {
    ...
    "main": {
      "type": "postgres",
      "connection_string": "user=root password=admin database=tyk-demo-db host=tyk-db port=5432"
    }
  }
} 
```
3. Run the following command:

```{copy.Wrapper}
./tyk-analytics migrate-sql
```
You will see output listing the transfer of each database table. For example: `Migrating 'tyk_apis' collection. Records found: 7`.

4. You can now remove your `mongo_url` (or `TYK_DB_MONGOURL` environment variable) from your `tyk-analytics.conf`
5. Restart your Tyk Dashboard

## PostgreSQL sizing

The aggregate record size depends on the number of APIs and Keys you have. Each counter size ~50b, and every aggregated value has its own counter. 

So an hourly aggregate record is computed like this: 50 * active_apis + 50 * api_versions + 50 * active_api_keys  + 50 * oauth_keys, etc. 

The average aggregate record size (created hourly) on our cloud is about ~ 40KB (a single record includes all the aggregate stats mentioned above).

So for 1 million requests per day, it will generate 1KB * 1M request stats (1GB) + 24 * 40KB aggregate stats (~1MB).

Per month: 30GB request logs + 30MB aggregate logs

## PostgreSQL Database Storage Calculator
You can calculate your PostgreSQL storage requirements by entering your known values in the middle section of the calculator settings below:
