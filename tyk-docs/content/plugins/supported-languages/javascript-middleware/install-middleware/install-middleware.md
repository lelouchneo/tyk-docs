Installing middleware is different for different releases of Tyk, for example, in Tyk Community Edition it is possible to directly specify a path to a file in the API Definition, while in Tyk Pro, we recommend using a directory-based loader.

**Note**  

Tyk Cloud Classic does not support custom middleware loading. However, it is possible with a [Tyk Multi-Cloud deployment]({{< ref "plugins/supported-languages/javascript-middleware/install-middleware/tyk-hybrid" >}}).
