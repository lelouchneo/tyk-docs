**Requirements**

*   [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) is required to run the following commands. Instructions on how install Tyk CE with shell is in the <b>Shell</b> tab.
*   Ensure port `8080` is open: this is used in this guide for Gateway traffic (the API traffic to be proxied).
{{< /note >}}

## Getting Started
1. clone the [tyk-ansible](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible) repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible
```

2. `cd` into the directory
```.bash
$ cd tyk-ansible
```

3. Run the initalisation script to initialise your environment

```bash
$ sh scripts/init.sh
```

4. Modify the `hosts.yml` file to update ssh variables to your server(s). You can learn more about the hosts file [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

5. Run ansible-playbook to install `tyk-ce`

```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -t tyk-ce -t redis
```

You can choose to not install Redis by using `-t redis`. However Redis is a requirement and needs to be installed for the Tyk Gateway to run.

**Requirements**

*   Ensure port `8080` is open: this is used in this guide for Gateway traffic (the API traffic to be proxied).
*   EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) is a free, community based repository project from Fedora which provides high quality add-on software packages for Linux distribution including RHEL, CentOS, and Scientific Linux. EPEL isn't a part of RHEL/CentOS but it is designed for major Linux distributions. In our case we need it for Redis. Install EPEL using the instructions [here](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F).
{{< /note >}}

### Install Redis using EPEL

```bash
sudo yum install -y redis
```

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

You may be asked to accept the GPG key for our repos and when the package installs, click yes to continue.
{{< /note >}}


*   Tyk requires Python 3.4. Install via the following command:

```bash
sudo yum install python34
```

### Start Redis

In many cases Redis might not be running, so let's start that:
```bash
sudo service redis start
```

### Run Installation Scripts via our PackageCloud Repositories

From [https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway) you have the following options:

* Via the correct package for your RHEL version. We have packages for the following:
 * RHEL 7
 * RHEL 6
 
* Via Quick Installation Instructions. You can use:
 * [Manual Instructions](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/install#manual-rpm)
 * [Chef](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/install#chef)
 * [Puppet](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/install#puppet)
 * [CI and Build Tools](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/ci)

### Configuring The Gateway 

You can set up the core settings for the Tyk Gateway with a single setup script, however for more involved deployments you will want to provide your own configuration file.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

You need to replace `<hostname>` for `--redishost=<hostname>` with your own value to run this script.
{{< /note >}}


```bash
sudo /opt/tyk-gateway/install/setup.sh --listenport=8080 --redishost=<hostname> --redisport=6379 --domain=""
```

What you've done here is told the setup script that:

*   `--listenport=8080`: Listen on port `8080` for API traffic.
*   `--redishost=<hostname>`: The hostname for Redis.
*   `--redisport=6379`: Use port `6379` for Redis.
*   `--domain=""`: Do not filter domains for the Gateway, see the note on domains below for more about this.

In this example, you don't want Tyk to listen on a single domain. It is recommended to leave the Tyk Gateway domain unbounded for flexibility and ease of deployment.

### Starting Tyk

The Tyk Gateway can be started now that it is configured. Use this command to start the Tyk Gateway:
```bash
sudo service tyk-gateway start
```
