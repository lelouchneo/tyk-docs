### Description

Users receive this error when attempting to create a new Policy on the Dashboard.

### Cause

The Access Rights field is a required setting for a policy.

### Solution

Users should first [create a new API]({{< ref "getting-started/create-api" >}}) and then [create a new policy]({{< ref "getting-started/create-security-policy" >}}) with an existing API in the Access Rights.
