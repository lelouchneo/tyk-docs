Tyk has three containers that are available to set up a Docker installation:

* [The Tyk Gateway container](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/tyk-gateway/)
* [The Tyk Dashboard container](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/tyk-dashboard/)
* [The Tyk Pump container](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/tyk-pump-docker-pub/)

All three are required for a full deployment. We recommend that each container is installed on a separate machine for optimum performance.

We also have a [Docker Tyk Pro Demo]({{< ref "tyk-on-premises/docker/docker-pro-demo" >}}), which installs our full Self-Managed solution, which includes our Gateway, Dashboard, and analytics processing pipeline. This demo will run Tyk Self-Managed on your machine.
