### Description
Users receive this error message when attempting to make API calls to an existing key.

### Cause
When the token was created, most probably it was configured without the `meta_data` key.

### Solution
The user will need to add the key-value pair `meta_data: {}` to their key as per the [Tyk Gateway REST API Documentation]({{< ref "tyk-gateway-api" >}}).
