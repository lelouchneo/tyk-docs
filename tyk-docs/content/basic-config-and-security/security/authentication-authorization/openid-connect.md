Tyk comes with support for OpenID Connect Identity Tokens provided by any standards compliant OIDC provider.

Getting OIDC support in the Dashboard requires only a few fields to be set up in the Core settings tab. for details see [Setting up OIDC]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/integrate/api-auth-mode/open-id-connect#setting-up-oidc" >}}) and a [worked example of using OpenID Connect with Auth0]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/integrate/api-auth-mode/oidc-auth0-example" >}}).
