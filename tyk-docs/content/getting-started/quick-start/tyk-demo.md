The [tyk-demo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-demo) library allows you stand up an entire Tyk Stack with
all its dependencies as well as other tooling that can integrate with Tyk. The library will spin up everything in
Docker using `docker compose` and bash magic to get you started.

Please visit the [tyk-demo repository](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-demo) for more information.
