[Tyk Cloud](https://tyk.io/cloud/) hosts and manages the control planes for you. You can deploy the data planes across multiple locations:
* as [Cloud Gateways]({{< ref "/content/tyk-cloud/environments-&-deployments/managing-gateways.md" >}}): deployed and managed in Tyk Cloud, in any of [5 regions available]({{< ref "/content/tyk-cloud/what-is-tyk-cloud.md#where-is-tyk-cloud-hosted" >}}). No need to care about deployment and operational concerns.
* as Hybrid Gateways: deployed locally and managed by you: in your own data centre, public or private cloud or even on your own machine

This page describes the deployment of hybrid data planes and how to connect them to Tyk Cloud, in both Kubernetes and Docker environments.

## Pre-requisites

* Tyk Cloud Account, register here if you don't have one yet: {{< button_left href="https://tyk.io/sign-up/#cloud" color="green" content="free trial" >}}
* A redis instance for each data plane, used as temporay storage for distributed rate limiting, token storage and analytics. You will find instructions for a simple Redis installation in the steps below. 
* No incoming firewalls rules are needed, as the connection between Hybrid Gateways and Tyk Cloud is always initiated from the Gateways, not from Tyk Cloud.

## Get the connection details to the control plane

The hybrid data plane can connect to control plane in Tyk Cloud by using the Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials. Follow the guides below to create a user (identity for hybrid data plane) and prepare the connection details:
* **Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials**: `api_key` setting in Docker, `gateway.rpc.apiKey` in helm
* **Organisation ID**: `rpc_key` setting in Docker, `gateway.rpc.rpcKey` in helm 
* **MDCB connection string**: `connection_string` setting in Docker, `gateway.rpc.connString` setting in helm

You need first to create a user that will be able to connect to the control plane. Go to the API Manager Dashboard. 

  {{< img src="/img/hybrid-gateway/tyk-cloud-dashboard-api-manager.png" alt="API Manager Dashboard" >}}

  - Within the API Manager Dashboard, select or create a user to be used as the login from your Hybrid gateways with `Real time notifications` as **read** permission.

  {{< img src="/img/hybrid-gateway/tyk-cloud-dashboard-api-manager-user.png" alt="API Manager Dashboard" >}}

  - Copy the **Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials** for later use (`api_key` setting in Docker, `gateway.rpc.apiKey` setting in helm)
  - Copy the **Organisation ID** for later use (`rpc_key` setting in Docker, `gateway.rpc.rpcKey` setting in helm)

  {{< img src="/img/hybrid-gateway/tyk-cloud-dashboard-api-manager-user-key.png" alt="API Manager Dashboard" >}}

That's all you need from the Tyk Manager. Go back to Tyk Cloud Console and retrieve the MDCB connection string for the gateways to connect to your control plane: 

{{< img src="/img/hybrid-gateway/tyk-cloud-hybrid-connection-control-plane.png" alt="MDCB connection string for the gateways to connect to your control plane" >}}

Copy this **MDCB connection string** for later use (`connection_string` setting in Docker, `gateway.rpc.connString` setting in helm).


## Deploy with Docker

### 1. In your terminal, clone the demo application [Tyk Gateway Docker](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker) repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker.git
```


### 2. Configure Tyk Gateway and its connection to Tyk Cloud

You need to modify the following values in [tyk.hybrid.conf](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker#hybrid) configuration file: 

* `rpc_key`: Organisation ID 
* `api_key`: Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials of the user created ealier
* `connection_string`: MDCB connection string
* *(optional)* `group_id`: if you have multiple data plane (e.g. in different regions), specify the data plane grou (string) to which the gateway you are deploying belong. The data planes in the same group share one redis.


```json
{
"rpc_key": "<ORG_ID>",
"api_key": "<API-KEY>",
"connection_string": "<MDCB-INGRESS>:443",
"group_id": "dataplane-europe",
}
``` 

* *(optional)* you can enable sharding to selectively load APIs to specific gateways, using the following:

```json
{
  "db_app_conf_options": {
    "node_is_segmented": true,
    "tags": ["qa", "uat"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Configure the connection to redis

This example comes with a redis instance pre-configured and deployed with Docker compose. If you want to use another redis instance, you will have to update the `storage` part of [tyk.hybrid.conf](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker#hybrid):

```json
{
  "storage": {
        "type": "redis",
        "host": "tyk-redis",
        "port": 6379,
        "username": "",
        "password": "",
        "database": 0,
        "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
        "optimisation_max_active": 4000
    }
}
```

### 4. Update docker compose file

Edit the <docker-compose.yml> file to to use the [tyk.hybrid.conf](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker#hybrid) that you have just configured.

From:

```yml
- ./tyk.standalone.conf:/opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf
```
To:

```yml
- ./tyk.hybrid.conf:/opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf
```

### 5. Run docker compose

Run the followng:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You should now have two running containers, a Gateway and a Redis.

### 6. Check that the gateway is up and running

Call the /hello endpoint using curl from your terminal (or any other HTTP client):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/hello -i
````

Expected result:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{"status":"pass","version":"4.3.3","description":"Tyk GW"}
```

## Deploy in Kubernetes with Helm

### 1. Add the Tyk official Helm repo `tyk-helm` to your local Helm repository

```bash
helm repo add tyk-helm https://helm.tyk.io/public/helm/charts/
helm repo update
```

The helm charts are also available on [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid).

### 2. Then create a new namespace that will be hosting the Tyk Gateways

```bash
kubectl create namespace tyk
```

### 3. Get the default values.yaml for configuration

Before proceeding with installation of the chart we need to set some custom values. First save the full original values.yaml to a local copy:

```bash
helm show values tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid > values.yaml
```

### 4. Configure Tyk Gateway and its connection to Tyk Cloud

You need to modify the following values in your custom `values.yaml` file: 

* `gateway.rpc.apiKey`: Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials of the user created ealier
* `gateway.rpc.rpcKey`: Organisation ID 
* `gateway.rpc.connString`: MDCB connection string
* *(optional)* `gateway.rpc.group_id`: if you have multiple data plane (e.g. in different regions), specify the data plane group (string) to which the gateway you are deploying belong. The data planes in the same group share one redis instance.
* *(optional)* `gateway.sharding.enabled` and `gateway.sharding.tags`: you can enable sharding to selectively load APIs to specific gateways, using tags. By default, sharing is disabled and gateway will load all APIs.

### 5. Configure the connection to redis

You can connect the gateway to any Redis instance already deployed (as DBaaS or hosted in your private infrastructure). 

In case you don't have a Redis instance yet, here's how to deploy Redis in Kubernetes using Bitnami Helm charts.

```bash
helm install tyk-redis bitnami/redis -n tyk
```

Follow the notes from the installation output to get connection details and password.

```bash
  Redis(TM) can be accessed on the following DNS names from within your cluster:

    tyk-redis-master.tyk.svc.cluster.local for read/write operations (port 6379)
    tyk-redis-replicas.tyk.svc.cluster.local for read-only operations (port 6379)

  export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace tyk tyk-redis -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)
```

You need to modify the following values in your custom `values.yaml` file: 

* `redis.addrs`: the name of the redis instance including the port as set by Bitnami `tyk-redis-master.tyk.svc.cluster.local:6379` 
* `redis.pass`: password set in redis (`$REDIS_PASSWORD`). Alternatively, you can use --set flag to set it during helm installation. For example `--set redis.pass=$REDIS_PASSWORD`.


### 6. Install Hybrid data plane

Install the chart using the configured custom values file:

```bash
helm install tyk-hybrid tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid -f values.yaml -n tyk
```

You should see the prompt:

```bash
At this point, Tyk Hybrid is fully installed and should be accessible.
```


### 7. Check that the installation was successful

The hybrid data planes are not yet visible in Tyk Cloud (coming soon!). Here is how you can check that the deployment was successfull.

Run this command in your terminal to check that all pods in the tyk namespace are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n tyk
````

**Expected result:**

```bash
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
gateway-tyk-hybrid-54b6c498f6-2xjvx   1/1     Running   0          4m27s
tyk-redis-master-0                    1/1     Running   0          47m
tyk-redis-replicas-0                  1/1     Running   0          47m
tyk-redis-replicas-1                  1/1     Running   0          46m
tyk-redis-replicas-2                  1/1     Running   0          46m
```

Note: if you are using a redis instance hosted somewhere else, then no redis pods will appear here. 

Run this command in your terminal to check that the services were correctly created:

```bash
kubectl get service -n tyk
````

**Expected result:**

```bash
NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE
gateway-svc-tyk-hybrid   NodePort    10.96.232.123    <none>        443:32668/TCP   44m
tyk-redis-headless       ClusterIP   None             <none>        6379/TCP        47m
tyk-redis-master         ClusterIP   10.109.203.244   <none>        6379/TCP        47m
tyk-redis-replicas       ClusterIP   10.98.206.202    <none>        6379/TCP        47m
```

Note: IP adresses might differ on your system. 


Finally, from your terminal, send a HTTP call to the /hello endpoint of the gateway `gateway-svc-tyk-hybrid`:

Note: you may need to port forward if you're testing on local machine, e.g. `kubectl port-forward service/gateway-svc-tyk-hybrid -n tyk 8080:443`

```bash
curl http://hostname:8080/hello -i
```

**Expected result:**

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2023 10:35:35 GMT
Content-Length: 234

{
  "status":"pass",
  "version":"4.3.3",
  "description":"Tyk GW",
  "details":{
    "redis": {"status":"pass","componentType":"datastore","time":"2023-03-15T11:39:10Z"},
    "rpc": {"status":"pass","componentType":"system","time":"2023-03-15T11:39:10Z"}}
}
```
