The main requirement to make it work is that SSL traffic should be terminated by Tyk itself. If you are using a load balancer, you should configure it to work in TCP mode.

## How Tyk Supports mutual TLS 

Tyk has support for mutual TLS in the following areas:

* [Client mTLS](./client-mtls)
* [Upstream mTLS](./upstream-mtls)

### mTLS for cloud users:
- Cloud users can secure their upstream services with mTLS but mTLS between the client (caller of the API) and Tyk's gateway cannot be done for the time being.
- Multi cloud users - since you own and manage the gateways, you can use mTLS for gateway <--> upstream  as well as client <--> gateway connections.

Before going into details about each of these areas, let's [describe the basic building blocks](./concepts) used to make it work.
