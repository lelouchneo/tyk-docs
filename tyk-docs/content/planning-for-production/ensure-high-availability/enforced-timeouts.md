Enforced timeouts are a good way to ensure that your service always responds within a given amount of time, even if a long-running process hangs. This is important in high-availability systems where response performance is crucial so errors can be dealt with cleanly.

If you are using the service discovery option, hard timeouts will force the service discovery module to refresh the host / host list.

### Enabling enforced timeouts in API Definitons

To enable an enforced timeout on a path, you must add to your versions' `extended_paths` section:

```{.copyWrapper}
extended_paths: {
  ...
  transform_response_headers: [],
  hard_timeouts: [{
  path: "delay/5",
  method: "GET",
  timeout: 3
}]
}
```

### Enabling enforced timeouts in the Tyk Dashboard API Designer

To enable an enforced timeout on an endpoint, select **Enforced timeout** plugin from the **Plugins** drop-down list:

{{< img src="/img/2.10/enforced_breakout.png" alt="Plugin dropdown" >}}

Then enter the enforced timeout in seconds for the endpoint:
