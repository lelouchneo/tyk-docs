## Overview

Tyk supports various ways of caching requests. At its simplest level, Tyk can cache all safe requests, however you can also manually set exactly which endpoint patterns to cache, and if that doesn't suffice, or you require more granular control, then you can enable upstream control and have your application tell Tyk whether to cache a request or not and for how long.

Invalidate Cache functionality is supported in MDCB Gateways from version 4.0 and 3.0.9

## Global

### Enabling Caching via an API Definition

To enable caching in your API, within your API definition you will need to set the `cache_options` flags in the main body of the definition:

```{.copyWrapper}
"cache_options": {
  "cache_timeout": 10,
  "enable_cache": true,
  "cache_all_safe_requests": false,
  "enable_upstream_cache_control": false,
  "cache_by_headers": [],
  "cache_response_codes": [200]
}
```

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

If you set `cache_all_safe_requests` to true, then the cache will be global and *all* inbound requests will be evaluated by the caching middleware. This is great for simple APIs, but for most a finer-grained control is required.

### Enabling Caching via the Dashboard

Follow these steps to enable caching via the Dashboard.

#### Step 1: Go to the Advanced Options

From the API Designer, select the **Advanced Options** tab:

{{< img src="/img/2.10/advanced_options_designer.png" alt="Advanced options tab location" >}}

#### Step 2: Set the Cache Options for the Global Cache

{{< img src="/img/2.10/cache_options.png" alt="Cache settings" >}}

Here you must set:

1.  **Enable caching**: To enable the cache middleware.
2.  **Cache timeout**: To set the timeout (in seconds) for cached requests.
3.  **Cache only these status codes**: To set which response codes to cache (remember to click **Add** after entering a response code).
4.  **Global cache**: Enable the global cache.

## Dynamic caching based on headers or body content

By default Tyk maintains a cache of an API key (if auth is enabled), request method and request path.
But you can have a dynamic cache for keys as well, and maintain a differnt cache based on the header or body content values.

For HTTP headers you can set the`cache_option.cache_by_headers` option. For example: 
```
"cache_options": {
   "cache_by_headers": ["Unique-user-Id"]
   ....
}
```

For request body based caching, it should be defined on a per endpoint level. Add the following config under the API definition `extended_paths` section:
```
"extended_paths": {
  "advance_cache_config": [
    {
      "method":"POST",
      "path":"addBooks",
      "cache_key_regex": "pattern"
    }
  ]
  ...
}
```

Both header and body dynamic caching is not exposed in the Dashboard UI, and needs to be enabled though either the raw API editor or via the Dashboard API. 

## Per-Path

To cache only specific endpoints, within the version data under the `extended_paths` section, you will need to define the paths to cache in the `cache` list:

```
extended_paths: {
  ignored: [],
  white_list: [],
  black_list: [],
  cache: [
      "widget",
      "badger",
      "fish"
  ],
  transform: [],
  transform_headers: []
}
```

Now Tyk will only cache the `/widget`, `/badger`, and `/fish` endpoints. Tyk will only cache safe requests, so currently `GET` and `HEAD` requests are the only supported HTTP methods. For many this will suffice with regards to caching requests; however in some cases you may wish to have full control over when to cache and be reactive about the time to live of the cached response.

You will still need to set the timeout and the response codes to validate in the cache configuration section.

### Setting Up a Per-Path Cache in the Dashboard

#### Step 1: Disable Global Cache

Ensure that the global cache is disabled (**Cache all safe requests** is not selected).

{{< img src="/img/2.10/advanced_options_designer.png" alt="Cache options form" >}}

You need to set:

1.  **Caching middleware**: To enable the cache middleware.
2.  **Cache timeout**: To set the timeout (in seconds) for cached requests.
3.  **Cache only these status codes**: To set which status codes to cache (click **Add** after entering a code).

#### Step 2: Select the Cache Plugin

Go to the Endpoint Designer tab. From the path you want to cache, select the **Cache** plugin option from the drop-down list.

{{< img src="/img/2.10/cache_plugin.png" alt="Plugin dropdown list" >}}

 
## Upstream Control

Upstream cache control enables you to set whether a response should be cached, and for how long. 
To enable this, you will need to set the following:

Step 1. In the API definition:
- `enable_cache: true` 
- `enable_upstream_cache_control: true`
- Set which paths to act upon. Add these paths as shown in the screengrab above or manually add these paths to the `cache` list in the `extended_paths` section of your API version as below:
``` json
"extended_paths": {
            "cache": [
              "ip"
            ]
          }
 ```          
Step 2. Use the upstream's response headers:
Tyk will evaluate the response headers sent from your application for these paths and based on the data in the response, activate and set the cache values.
The two response headers that Tyk looks for are:
1.  `x-tyk-cache-action-set`: If Tyk finds this header set to `1`, the request will be cached, even if it's not a safe request since the upstream control overwrites Tyk's cache setting. Ifthe header's value is `0` or no such header, even if it's a safe request it will not be cached, again, upstream control overwrites Tyk's.
2.  `x-tyk-cache-action-set-ttl`: If Tyk finds this header, it will override the TTL of the cached response, otherwise it will default to `cache_options.cache_timeout`.
You can also change this header to a header of your choice by setting the fields `cache_options.cache_control_ttl_header`.

Utilising this approach gives the most control as it will also only cache responses based on the request method. So if you only want `OPTIONS` requests to be cached, and return cache control headers only for this method, then only that method/URL combination will be cached, ignoring other methods for the same path.


### Configuration via the Dashboard UI

Under the Advanced settings, ensure that **Enable upstream cache control** is selected and **Global cache** is not selected, then follow the steps for per-path caching.

## A Separate Redis Cache

For high-traffic systems that make heavy use of caching as well as rate limiting, it makes sense to separate out the Redis cache server from the Redis configuration server that supplies auth tokens and handles rate limiting configuration.

To enable a separate cache server, update your `tyk.conf` with the following section:

```{.copyWrapper}
"enable_separate_cache_store": true,
"cache_storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "host": "",
  "port": 0,
  "addrs": [
      "localhost:6379"
  ],
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 3000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 5000,
  "enable_cluster": false
},
```

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

`addrs` is new in v2.9.3, and replaces `hosts` which is now deprecated.
{{< /note >}}

If you set `enable_cluster` to `false`, you only need to set one entry in `addrs`:

The configuration is the same (and uses the same underlying driver) as the regular configuration, so Redis Cluster is fully supported.
