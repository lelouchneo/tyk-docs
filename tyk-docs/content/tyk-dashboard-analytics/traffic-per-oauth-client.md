Traffic statistics are available on a per OAuth Client ID basis if you are using the OAuth mode for one of your APIs. To get a breakdown view of traffic aggregated to a Client ID, you will need to go to the **System Management -> APIs** section and then under the **OAuth API**, there will be a button called **OAuth API**. Selecting an OAuth client will then show its aggregate activity

In the API list view â€“ an **OAuth Clients** button will appear for OAuth enabled APIs, use this to browse to the Client ID and the associated analytics for that client ID:

You can view the analytics of individual tokens generated by this Client ID in the regular token view.
