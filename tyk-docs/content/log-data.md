## Logging

Tyk will log its output to `stderr` and `stdout`. In a typical installation, these will be handled or redirected by the service manager running the process, and depending on the Linux distribution, will either be output to `/var/log/` or `/var/log/upstart`.

Tyk will try to output structured logs, and so will include context data around request errors where possible.

### Logging level

Log data is usually of the Error level and higher, though you can enable Debug mode reporting by adding the `--debug` flag to the process run command.

{{< warning success >}}
**Warning**  

Debug mode logging generates a lot of output and is not recommended.
{{< /warning >}}


### How do I increase Logging Verbosity?

You can set the logging verbosity in two ways:

 1. Via an Environment Variable to affect all Tyk components
 2. Just for the Gateway via your `tyk.conf` config file  

### Setting via Environment Variable

The environment variable is `TYK_LOGLEVEL`.

By default, the setting is `info`. You also have the following options:

* `debug`
* `warn`
* `error`

You will be advised by support which setting to change the logging level to.

### For the Gateway Only

You can set the logging level in your `tyk.conf` by adding the following:

```{.copyWrapper}
  "log_level": "info",
```

If unset or left empty, it will default to `info`. 


Tyk will try to output structured logs, and so will include context data around request errors where possible.

When contacting support, you may be asked to change the logging level as part of the support handling process. See [Support Information]({{< ref "troubleshooting/tyk-gateway/support-information" >}}) for more details.


## Integration with 3rd party aggregated log and error tools

### Aggregated logs with Sentry

Tyk's logger supports multiple back-ends, the one that currently ships with Tyk is the Sentry hook. This makes it possible to send log data from multiple Tyk processes to a Sentry server in order to monitor the context around HTTP errors and other notifications created by Tyk.

To enable Sentry as a log aggregator, update these settings in both your `tyk.conf` and your `tyk_analytics.conf`:

*   `use_sentry`: Set this to `true` to enable the Sentry logger, you must specify a Sentry DSN under `sentry_code`.

*   `sentry_code`: The Sentry-assigned DSN (a kind of URL endpoint) that Tyk can send log data to.

### Aggregated logs with Logstash

Tyk's logger supports multiple back-ends, as of v2.3 Logstash is a supported log aggregation back end.

To enable Logstash as a log aggregator, update these settings in your `tyk.conf`:

*   `use_logstash`: Set this to `true` to enable the Logstash logger.

*   `logstash_transport`: The Logstash transport to use, should be `"tcp"`.

*   `logstash_network_addr`: Set to the Logstash client network address, should be in the form of `hostname:port`.

### Aggregated logs with Graylog

Tyk's logger supports multiple back-ends, as of v2.3 Graylog is a supported log aggregation back end.

To enable Graylog as a log aggregator, update these settings in your `tyk.conf`:

*   `use_graylog`: Set this to `true` to enable the Graylog logger.

*   `graylog_network_addr`: The Graylog client address in the form of `<graylog_ip>:<graylog_port>`.

### Aggregated logs with Syslog

Tyk's logger supports multiple back-ends, as of v2.3 Syslog is a supported log aggregation back end.

To enable Syslog as a log aggregator, update these settings in your `tyk.conf`:

*   `use_syslog`: Set this to `true` to enable the Syslog logger.

*   `syslog_transport`: The Syslog transport to use, should be `"udp"` or empty.

*   `syslog_network_addr`: Set to the Syslog client network address, should be in the form of `hostname:port`
