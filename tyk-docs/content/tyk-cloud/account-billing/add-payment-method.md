4. Enter your card details and click Save.
5. You'll see confirmation that the payment method was added successfully.

## Payment Method Maintenance

As a Billing Admin you can also edit or delete an existing payment method. If you delete a payment method and you do not add a new one, your plan will go into [retirement]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/account-billing/retirement" >}}) at the end of your current billing cycle.
