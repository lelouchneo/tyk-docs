## Introduction

Environments are used to group your [Control Plane]({{< ref "/content/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary.md#control-plane" >}}) and [Edge Gateways]({{< ref "/content/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-&-support/glossary.md#edge" >}}) into logical groups. For example you may want to create environments that reflect different departments of your organisation.

**Note**
  
The number of Environments you can create is determined by your [plan]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/account-billing/plans" >}})

3. Give your new Environment a name
4. Click **Create**


## Editing an Existing Environment

An Org Admin can perform the following:

* Rename an Environment
* Delete an Environment

1. Click the environment Name from your list
