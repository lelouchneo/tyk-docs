### Introduction

Tyk has always had a proprietary specification for defining APIs. From Tyk v4.1 Tyk now also supports defining APIs using the [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) (OAS) which can offer significant time and complexity savings. This is an [early access capability]({{< ref "/content/frequently-asked-questions/using-early-access-features.md" >}}).

As we extend our OAS support, we would very much like your feedback on how we can extend and update to best meet your needs: We have created an [OAS Category](https://community.tyk.io/c/oas/21) in our [Community Forum](https://community.tyk.io/) if you do have any feedback or questions.

This capability is available in both the open source and paid versions of Tyk. See our [High Level Concepts]({{< ref "/content/getting-started/key-concepts/high-level-concepts.md" >}}) for more details. We also have a [glossary of terms]({{< ref "/content/getting-started/using-oas-definitions/oas-glossary.md" >}}), or, if you canâ€™t wait to get started, head on over to [Using OAS API Definitions]({{< ref "/content/getting-started/using-oas-definitions.md" >}}) for tutorials.
