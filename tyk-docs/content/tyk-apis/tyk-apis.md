We have our own APIs and a Postman public workspace.

## Tyk Postman Collections

We have a Postman public workspace where you can view, fork and test our Gateway and Dashboard APIs.

## [Tyk Gateway API](/docs/tyk-gateway-api/)

This API is very small, and has no granular permissions system. It is used purely for internal automation and integration. It offers the following endpoints:

* Managing session objects (key generation)
* Managing and listing API Definitions (only when not using the Dashboard)
* Hot reloads / reloading a cluster configuration
* OAuth client creation (only when not using the Dashboard)

This allows you to test, connect to and control your Gateway.

## [Tyk Dashboard API](/docs/tyk-dashboard-api/)

The Tyk Dashboard API allows much more fine-grained, secure and multi-user access to your Tyk cluster, and should be used to manage a database-backed Tyk node. The Tyk Dashboard API works seamlessly with the Tyk Dashboard.


## [Tyk Dashboard Admin API](/docs/dashboard-admin-api/)

The Dashboard Admin API is a special bootstrapping API that can be used to set up and provision a Tyk Dashboard instance without the command line and is used by the bootstrap scripts that come with a Tyk On-Premises installation. There is no public Postman collection for this API.

## [Tyk Portal API](/docs/tyk-portal-api/)

The Tyk Portal API covers all available endpoints for your developer portal.
