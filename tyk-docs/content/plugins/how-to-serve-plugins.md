If you are using gRPC, [please visit the gRPC section]({{< ref "plugins/supported-languages/rich-plugins/grpc" >}}), as you don't add plugin files to the Tyk Gateway for it to read, it will simply make a connection to your gRPC server.

**For everything else, there are two ways to add custom plugins:**

1.  Publish the plugin on an HTTP Server so the Gateway can download it. [This is called Bundling.]({{< ref "plugins/how-to-serve-plugins/plugin-bundles" >}})

2.  Mount your custom plugin on the Gateway's file system.  Find examples under your favorite  programming language under [Supported Languages](../supported-languages)
