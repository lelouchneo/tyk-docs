### Description

After creating an SSO Identity profile in the Tyk Dashboard, a user is unable to log in to the Dashboard or the Developer Portal

### Cause

One potential cause is that the `DashboardCredential` setting has not been populated with the user's Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials.
You can check this from:

1. From the Dashboard menu, select the Identity Management option
2. Edit the profile you created
3. Select the Raw Editor
4. Check to see if the `DashboardCredential` setting is set

### Workaround Solution

If, as above, the `DashboardCredential` setting is empty (`"DashboardCredential": ""`), you can manually add the user's Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials by performing the following:

1. From the System Management > Users menu, select Actions > Edit from the user whose credentials you want to use
2. Copy the **Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials** value

{{< img src="/img/2.10/user_api_credentials.png" alt="User API Access Credentials" >}}

3. Paste this into the Raw editor for the `DashboardCredential` setting. For example - `"DashboardCredential": "887dad0de40b4ff05b6b50739b311099"`
4. Click **Update**
5. The user should now be able to log in to the Dashboard/Portal
