Open source is at the heart of what we do. Anything that is API Gateway-related, lives in the Gateway, or is critical for the Gateway to work is open and freely available via our [Github](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/).

Our commitment to open source also delivers a host of benefits for our users: signup for free with Tyk, receive securely packaged open source packages, getting started guides, access to our community and all of the latest open source information.

To get started and test it out:

At the center of everything is the Tyk Gateway.  The primary application for Open Source and paid users alike, the Tyk Open Source API Gateway does all the heavy lifting.
