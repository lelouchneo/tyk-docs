In some cases you may want to compose multiple API calls or multiple APIs into a bundled or batched request. This is possible with Tyk and can be easily achieved using our [Virtual Endpoint]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/compose-apis/virtual-endpoints" >}}) and the Batch Request section of the [Tyk Gateway API]({{< ref "tyk-gateway-api" >}}) features.
